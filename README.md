# Coding-Nomads-Capstone: Basics of Recommendation systems
This project is to show the foundations of how most recommendation systems work.
Traditional approaches such as collaborartive and content filtering are implemented in addition to synopsis similarity filtering.

* pandas
* sklearn
* bs4(Beautiful soup)
